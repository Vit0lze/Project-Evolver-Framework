# **🛠️ Project Evolver Framework (Phase 1: Correction)**

A modular AI-driven framework designed to analyze, research, and heal software architectures using specialized skills. This framework moves beyond simple code generation by implementing a structured, medical-grade approach to software maintenance and evolution.

## 

## **🧬 The Ecosystem**

This phase focuses on **The Surgery**. Instead of random fixes, the framework follows a structured path from diagnosis to execution, utilizing specialized roles.

|Skill|Role|Responsibility|
|-|-|-|
|**Skill 1: Mapper**|The Radiologist|Scans the project, identifies "Breaking Points", and defines the Vision.|
|**Skill 2: Explorer**|The Surgeon's Planner|Deep-dives into flaws, researches patterns, and maps the "Blast Radius".|
|**Skill 3: Injector**|The Surgeon|Executes senior-level, full-stack code injections and architectural fixes.|

## 

## **🚀 Execution Workflow**

### 

### **1. Diagnosis**

* **Trigger:** Use the @project-evolver-mapper skill to start analyzing this project. Start with the **Proactive Vision Interview**.
* **Result:** Generates a GLOBAL\_MAP.md containing all structural flaws and defined project goals.

### 

### **2. Deep-Dive Research**

* **Trigger:** Use the @project-field-explorer skill to investigate the Breaking Points identified in the Global Map.
* **Result:** Produces detailed research reports (Frontend/Backend) including **Solution IDs** and business rules preservation strategies.

### 

### **3. Surgical Implementation**

* **Trigger:** Use the @project-evolution-injector to implement the fixes described in @Report Names.
* **Result:** Performs senior-grade code refactoring across the entire stack, ensuring type-safety and long-term stability.

## 

## **📈 Key Metrics**

* **Token Efficiency:** Up to **70% reduction** in token waste by avoiding "guess-and-check" cycles.
* **Accuracy:** Preserves the **"Golden Rules"** of business logic while refactoring underlying architecture.
* **Speed:** Resolves complex full-stack bugs in **minutes**, rather than days.

## 

## **📝 Usage Note**

Always ensure that the GLOBAL\_MAP.md is updated before proceeding to the Injection phase to maintain a consistent architectural source of truth.
